# The framework to supervise your industrial activity and coordinate your operators
OperatorFabric is an open source framework written in Java, that makes it easy to write software for a simplified and better coordination.

## The well named OperatorFabric (AKA OpFab || OF)
OperatorFabric therefore exists to facilitate and improve cooperation between Operators on the basis of industrial processes (whatever their business, by the way)!
- Operator represents human being ... let's say operating in control room
- Fabric, from a modern digital perspective, is used as a metaphor to illustrate the idea of a simple work for building softwares

When we started this project it felt kind of natural to call it OperatorFabric (given what it naturally does).
Then with time operatorfabric got its shortname: OpFab (I guess we donâ€™t need to explain :-.)
And in the end, in emails and presentations and such, we started referring to it with an even smaller form: OF.
