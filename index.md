#A Smart Assistant For System Operators
OperatorFabric is a modular, extensible, industrial-strength and field-tested platform for use in electricity, water, and other utility operations.
- System visualization and console integration
- Precise alerting
- Workflow scheduling
- Remedial action manager
- Historian
- Scripting (ex: Python, JavaScript)

OperatorFabric is written in Java that makes it easy to write software for a simplified and better coordination.

##Ethymology and history of the name
- Operator represents human being ... let's say operating in control room
- Fabric, from a modern digital perspective, is used as a metaphor to illustrate the idea of a simple work for building softwares

When we started this project it felt kind of natural to call it OperatorFabric (given what it naturally does).
Then with time operatorfabric got its shortname: OpFab (I guess we donâ€™t need to explain :-.)
And in the end, in emails and presentations and such, we started referring to it with an even smaller form: OF.
